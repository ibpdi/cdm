: a owl:Ontology .

:BuildingType a owl:Class .

:Retail a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :BuildingType ;
    rdfs:label "Retail"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "building type retail"@en .

:HighStreet a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Retail ;
    rdfs:label "HighStreet"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "building type HighStreet"@en .

how to get the class from enum?
What does it mean: primary and secondary???
What do we do with "Other"? "Retail" == "Retail, Other" -> NO! "Retail" != "Retail, Other"

:RetailOther a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Retail .

# customer extention integrates in the existing clas hierarchy 
xyz:PopupStore a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :RetailOther .
